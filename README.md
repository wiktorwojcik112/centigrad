### A neural network library written in C

This is my attempt at writing my own neural network library. It's based on
Karpathy's micrograd and is written in C as an additional challenge. All of the
code (excluding tests) has been written without using AI.

The project is in progress. All of the implemented tests are passing at this
moment.
